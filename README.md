# Major-Project CS [ Big Data Privacy]

#### We worked on modifying the popular clustering algorithms and then applied K anonymity on the dataset to draw comparisions between the classical and modified clustering algorithms in terms of their Info Gain and Data Privacy.
 
 #### My task involved modifying the DBSCAN algorithm.
 #### Task done:
 * The given task was performed on **Heart and Adult Dataset**.
 * Modified the DBSCAN Clustering algorithm to use **Mutual Information Correlation** to form clusters.
 * Formed Clusters using DBSCAN(classical) and DBSCAN'(modified).
 * Clusters in both the cases were anonymised using K anonymity.
 * Info Gain was calculated for both the cases.
 
 ### Results:
 * The privacy offered by modified DBSCAN was found to be greater than that of the Classical DBSCAN.
